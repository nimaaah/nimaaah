## Hi there üëã I'm Nima: mechanical engineering grad, software developer, systems designer. Currently based in Montr√©al, QC.

I have a distinct passion for the intersection of mechanical and real-time software systems. +2 years of experience in various disciplines (software development, technical demos, prototyping).

I‚Äôm an avid soccer fan - the best way to reach me is to either write an email, or to meet me on the pitch! ‚öΩÔ∏è
